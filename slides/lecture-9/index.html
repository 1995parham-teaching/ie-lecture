  <h2>Web Application Development</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>(Large) Applications cannot be developed in ad-hoc manner</li>
    <ul>
      <li>We need design &amp; architecture (software engineering)</li>
      <li>Concept separation, Component, Relations, ...</li>
    </ul>
    <li>There are so many architectural patterns</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Common architectures in web applications</li>
      <ul>
        <li>MVC, MVVM, ...</li>
        <li>Multi-layer (Multi-tier), Microservices, ...</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>MVC: Model-View-Controller</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Model</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Does all the computational work</li>
        <ul>
          <li>It contains data and performs computation on it</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>View (the user interface)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Show the results from model or controller</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>Controller (of states sequences)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Handles events/requests affecting model or view</li>
        <ul>
          <li>User inputs/requests go to the controller</li>
          <li>
            Available commands are determined by controller (based on model)
          </li>
          <li>Tells the model what to do</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Examples: MS Excel</li>

    <h2>MVVM Design Pattern</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the role of the controller in MVC?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Basically updates V by changes in M and vice versa</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Instead of coding the C, make it automated</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Automatically update M by changes in V</li>
        <li>Automatically update V by changes in M</li>
        <li>Two-way binding</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>The Model-View-ViewModel pattern</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The view model is a value converter</li>
        <li>
          Responsible for exposing (converting) the data objects from the model
          in such a way that objects are easily managed and presented.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

  <h2>Layering Approach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Common layering in web applications</li>
    <ul>
      <li><em class="hl-orange">Presentation</em> Layer</li>
      <li><em class="hl-green">Business</em> logic Layer</li>
      <li><em class="hl-cyan">Data (management/resource)</em> Layer</li>
    </ul>
    <li>These layers are purely abstractions</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong class="hl-red">Not</strong> correspond to physical distribution
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>All layers may or may not be on the same machine</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Physical layering is referred as
        <em class="hl-yellow">multi-tier</em> architecture
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Presentation Layer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>User interface of the application</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Native (Windows Application, Android Application, etc.)</li>
      <li>Web-Based</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Displays information (processing output) which are get from the business
      logic layer
    </li>
    <li>
      Gets user’s requests and pass them (with required data) to the business
      logic layer
    </li>
    <li>
      Note that the user interface of web applications can be made up client
      side &amp; server side codes
    </li>
    <li>What is this layer in Gmail?</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Business Logic Layer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The work that the application needs to do</li>
    <li>Receives requests from presentation layer</li>
    <li>Fetches required data from data layer</li>
    <li>Process the request &amp; data</li>
    <li>Output is sent back to the presentation layer</li>
    <li>What does this layer do in Gmail?</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Data Layer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provides data access interface to business logic</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Hide data storage details</li>
      <li>Hide heterogeneity of underlining systems</li>

  <h2>Micro-Service Idea</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Complex process can be divided into multiple
      <em class="hl-orange">loosely-coupled</em> components
    </li>
    <li>Each component</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Is autonomous</li>
      <li>Provides well-defined services</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Via Remote API call</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Distributed application</li>
          <li>Easy to scale</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Different technologies can be used</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Microservices Architecture</h2>
  <img src="./img/micro.png" alt="mirco" />
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The Four Tiers of a Microservice Application</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Platform: A microservice platform provides tooling, infrastructure, and
      high-level primitives to support the rapid development, operation, and
      deployment of microservices.
    </li>
    <li>
      Services: In this tier, the service that you build interact with each
      other to provide business and technical capabilities, supported by the
      underlying platform
    </li>
    <li>
      Boundary: Clients will interact with your application through a defined
      boundary that expose underlying functionality to meet the needs of outside
      consumers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Client: Client applications, such as websites and mobile applications,
      interact with your microservice backend.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>What Makes Microservices Challenging?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em class="hl-orange">Scoping and identifying microservices</em> requires
      substantial domain knowledge.
    </li>
    <li>
      The right <em class="hl-green">boundaries and contracts</em> between
      services are difficult to identify and, once you've established them, can
      be time-consuming to change.
    </li>
    <li>
      Microservices are <em class="hl-cyan">distributed systems</em> and
      therefore require different assumptions to be made about state,
      consistency, and network reliability.
    </li>
    <li>
      By distributing system components across networks, and increasing
      technical heterogeneity, microservices introduce
      <em class="hl-yellow">new modes of failure</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      It's more challenging to understand and verify what should happen in
      normal operation.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Transactions?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Where did you hear it?</li>
      <li>ACID Properties</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Atomicity</li>
        <li>Consistency</li>
        <li>Isolation</li>
        <li>Durability</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Atomicity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Transactions are often composed of multiple statements</li>
      <li>
        Atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single
        "unit", which either succeeds completely, or fails completely
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          if any of the statements constituting a transaction fails to complete,
          the entire transaction fails and the system is left unchanged.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Consistency</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the system from
        one valid state to another
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Isolation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Transactions are often executed concurrently</li>
      <li>
        Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the
        system in the same state that would have been obtained if the
        transactions were executed sequentially.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Durability</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it
        will remain committed even in the case of a system failure (e.g., power
        outage or crash).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>A Real Story 🔥</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There was a micro-service architectured IoT Platform - 2018</li>
      <li>
        Users can create project and each project must be created on API
        gateway, X and Y services
      </li>
      <li>
        Requests are handled by API gateway and then it call X and Y services to
        create a new project
      </li>
      <li>
        Sometimes X service failed to create project and sometimes Y service
        isn't available to handle the request
      </li>
      <li>In each of these cases system goes into unrecoverable state</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>CAP Theorem</h2>
  <p>
    Impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than
    two out of the following three guarantees:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em class="hl-orange">Consistency</em>: Every read receives the most
      recent write or an error
    </li>
    <li>
      <em class="hl-green">Availability</em>: Every request receives a
      (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most
      recent write
    </li>
    <li>
      <em class="hl-yellow">Partition tolerance</em>: The system continues to
      operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed)
      by the network between nodes
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Asynchronous Messages</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>More flexible</li>
    <li>
      By announcing <strong class="hl-orange">events</strong>, you make it easy
      to extend the system to handle new requirements, because services no
      longer need to have knowledge of their downstream consumers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Asynchronous messaging typically requires a
      <em class="hl-gree">communication broker</em>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An independent system component that receives events and distributes
        them to event consumers.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
