      <strong class="hl-green">infrastructure</strong> like physical computing
      resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc.

    <strong class="hl-cyan">develop</strong>,
    <strong class="hl-orange">run</strong>, and

  <h2>Containers</h2>
  <p>
    Containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and
    dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and
    share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated
    processes in user space.
