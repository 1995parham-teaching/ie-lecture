    <h2>IaaS</h2>
    <p>
      Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that
      <em class="hl-orange">abstract</em>
      the user from the details of
      <strong class="hl-green">infrastructure</strong> like physical computing
      resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc.
    </p>

    <li>Example providers:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>AWS Amazon</li>
      <li>Virtual Box</li>
      <li>VMware</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>PaaS</h2>
  <p>
    Platform as a service (PaaS) or application platform as a service (aPaaS) is
    a category of cloud computing services that
    <em class="hl-yellow">provides a platform</em> allowing customers to
    <strong class="hl-cyan">develop</strong>,
    <strong class="hl-orange">run</strong>, and
    <strong class="hl-green">manage</strong> applications without the complexity
    of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with
    developing and launching an app.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SaaS</h2>
  <p>
    SaaS applications are sometimes called
    <em class="hl-yellow">Web-based software</em>, on-demand software, or hosted
    software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications
    <strong class="hl-green">run on a SaaS providerâ€™s servers</strong>. The
    provider manages access to the application, including security,
    availability, and performance.

    In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system.

  <h2>Types of Virtualization</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Partitioning: This is a type of virtualization in which a CPU is devided
      into different parts, and each part works as an individaul system.
    </li>
    <li>
      Full virtualization: In full virtualization, a virtual machine is used to
      simulate regular hardware while not being aware of the fact that is's
      virtualized.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Software-based: Uses binary translation to virtualize the execution of
        sensitive instruction sets while emulating hardware using software,
        which increase overhead and impacts scalibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hardware-based: Removes binary translation from the equation while
        interfacing with a CPU's virtualization features (AMD-V, Intel VT),
        which, in turn, means that instruction sets are being executed directly
        on the host CPU
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Paravirtualization: This is a type in which the guest OS understands the
      fact that it's being virtualized and needs to be modified, along with its
      drivers, so that it can run on top of the virtulization solution.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hybrid virtualization: This is a type of virtualization that uses full
      virtualization and paravirtualization's biggest virtues.
    </li>
    <li>
      Container-based virtualization: This is a type of application
      virtualization that uses containers. A container is an object that
      packages an application and all its dependencies so that the application
      can be scaled out and rapidly deployed without needing a virtual machine
      or a hypervisor.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Containers</h2>
  <p>
    Containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and
    dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and
    share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated
    processes in user space.
