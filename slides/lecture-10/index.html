    <h2>IaaS</h2>
    <p>
      Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that
      <em class="hl-orange">abstract</em>
      the user from the details of
      <strong class="hl-green">infrastructure</strong> like physical computing
      resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc.
    </p>
  </section>

    <li>Example providers:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>AWS Amazon</li>
      <li>Virtual Box</li>
      <li>VMware</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>PaaS</h2>
  <p>
    Platform as a service (PaaS) or application platform as a service (aPaaS) is
    a category of cloud computing services that
    <em class="hl-yellow">provides a platform</em> allowing customers to
    <strong class="hl-cyan">develop</strong>,
    <strong class="hl-orange">run</strong>, and
    <strong class="hl-green">manage</strong> applications without the complexity
    of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with
    developing and launching an app.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SaaS</h2>
  <p>
    SaaS applications are sometimes called
    <em class="hl-yellow">Web-based software</em>, on-demand software, or hosted
    software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications
    <strong class="hl-green">run on a SaaS provider‚Äôs servers</strong>. The
    provider manages access to the application, including security,
    availability, and performance.

    In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system.

  <h2>Virtualization Techniques</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The <strong>VM-based</strong> approach virtualizes the complete OS. The
      abstraction it presents to the VM are virtual devices like virtual disk,
      virtual CPUs, and virtual NICs. With virtual machines, multiple OSes can
      share the same hardware resources, with virtualized representations of
      each of the resources available to the VM.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Container-based</strong> form of virtualization doesn't abstract
      the hardware but uses techniques within the Linux kernel to isolate access
      paths for different resources. It carves out a logical boundary within the
      same operating system.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Hypervisors</h2>
  <p>A special piece of software is used to virtualize the OS.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <section>
    <h2>CPU Virtualization</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Binary Translation in the Case of Full Virtualization:</strong>
        In this case, the guest OS is used without any changes. The instructions
        are trapped and emulated for the target environment. This cause a lot of
        performance overhead, as lots of instructions have to be trapped into
        the host/hypervisor and emulated.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Paravirtualization: This is a type in which the guest OS understands the
        fact that it's being virtualized and needs to be modified, along with
        its drivers, so that it can run on top of the virtulization solution.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hybrid virtualization: This is a type of virtualization that uses full
        virtualization and paravirtualization's biggest virtues.
      </li>
      <li>
        Container-based virtualization: This is a type of application
        virtualization that uses containers. A container is an object that
        packages an application and all its dependencies so that the application
        can be scaled out and rapidly deployed without needing a virtual machine
        or a hypervisor.

  <h2>Containers</h2>
  <p>
    Containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and
    dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and
    share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated
    processes in user space.

  <h2>Days before Docker</h2>

    <li>Creates conflict with previous installation</li>
    <li>Separate Environment - Separate Runtime</li>
    <li>Code that runs on one system and doesn‚Äôt on the other</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Days after Docker</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Dependencies and runtime environment are all in the same place</li>
    <li>No need to install any dependency üíÉ</li>
    <li>Ensuring your app and your dependencies travel together</li>

  <h2>Docker Image</h2>
  <p>
    An image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes
    everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime,
    libraries, environment variables, and config files.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Docker Container</h2>
  <p>
    A container is a runtime instance of an image ‚Äì what the image becomes in
    memory when actually executed. It runs completely isolated from the host
    environment by default, only accessing host files and ports if configured to
    do so.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Dockerfile</h2>
  <p>
    A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could
    call on the command line to assemble an image.
  </p>

  <h2>Docker Volumes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Data volumes can be shared and reused among containers.</li>
    <li>Changes to a data volume are made directly.</li>
    <li>
      Changes to a data volume will not be included when you update an image.
