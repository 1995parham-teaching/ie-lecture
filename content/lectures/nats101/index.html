  <h2>History</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      NATS is a high-performance messaging system created by Derek Collison in
      2010
    </li>
    <li>
      It was originally built to serve as the message bus for Cloud Foundry
    </li>
    <li>Handling internal communication among components of the system</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Client publishes message on <q>foo</q> subject</li>
    <li>Only clients subscribed to <q>foo</q> receive the message</li>

  <h2>Request/Response</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Client connected to NATS publishes a request on a <q>help</q> subject
    </li>
    <li>
      Worker client subscribed to <q>help</q>, processes requests, then sends
      response
    </li>
    <li>
      Audit client is subscribed to all subjects via a wildcard, so also
      receives message but does not reply
    </li>
    <li>Publisher receieves the response from the worker client</li>
  </ol>
  <img src="./img/rr.png" alt="rr" />
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Queue</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Publisher sends multiple help requests on a <q>help</q> subject</li>
    <li>
      Multiple worker clients subscribed to the <q>help</q> subject from a
      distributed queue
    </li>
    <li>
      Each published request is randomly balanced to only one of the worker
      clients in the distributed queue
    </li>

  <h2>NATS As an Always Available Dial Tone</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The main design constraints that define the style of the NATS project are:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Simplicity</li>
      <li>Performance</li>
      <li>Reliability</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      It does not offer any <span class="hl-orange">Persistence</span> or
      <span class="hl-green">Buffering</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      It is true <span class="hl-red">Fire</span> and
      <span class="hl-cyan">Forget</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <section>
    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        NATS will try to protect itself at all costs to be available for all
        users
      </li>
      <li>
        NATS client libraries, internally try to have an always established
        connection to one of the available NATS servers
      </li>
      <li>
        In case a server fails, NATS will reconnect to another available server
        in the pool
      </li>
      <li>
        NATS supports high-availablity via a clustering mode that is set up as a
        <span class="hl-orange">full-mesh</span> of the servers
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Slow Consumer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      By default, if a client fails to drain the pending data that the server is
      holding for the client for over two seconds, the server will disconnect
      the client
    </li>

  <h2>Ping/Pong</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      There is a PING/PONG interval happing that the client has to follow
      otherwise the server will reset the connection in case there are many PONG
      replies missing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Server sends PING messages to client in each interval and client has to
      respond
    </li>
    <li>Client also can send PING messages to the server</li>

    <h2>Subject Names</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The dot character (.) has special meaning as part of the subject</li>
      <li>
        When using it as part of the subject, we can create namespaces that can
        be later matched via wildcards

  <h2>Jetstream</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>JetStream</strong> is a NATS built-in distributed persistence
      system.
    </li>
    <li>
      JetStream is built-in to nats-server and you only need 1 (or 3 or 5 if you
      want fault-tolerance against 1 or 2 simultaneous NATS server failures) of
      your NATS server(s) to be JetStream enabled for it to be available to all
      the client applications.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Functionalities enabled by JetStream</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Streaming: temporal decoupling between the publishers and subscribers
    </li>
    <li>Replay policies</li>
    <li>Retention policies and limits</li>
    <li>Persistent distributed storage</li>
    <li>Stream replication factor</li>

    <h2>Streaming</h2>
    <h3>temporal decoupling between the publishers and subscribers</h3>
    <p>
      Subscribers only receive the messages that are published when they are
      <em class="hl-orange">actively connected to the messaging system</em>
      (i.e. they do not receive messages that are published while they are not
      subscribing or not running or disconnected).
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>
      However, nowadays a new way to provide this temporal de-coupling has been
      devised and has become 'mainstream':
      <strong class="hl-green">streaming</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em class="hl-cyan">Streams</em> capture and store messages published on
      one (or more) subject and allow client applications to create
      <em class="hl-yellow">subscribers (i.e. JetStream consumers)</em> at any
      time to <em class="hl-orange">replay (or consume)</em> all or some of the
      messages stored in the stream
    </p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section>
    <h2>Replay policies</h2>
    <p>
      JetStream <em class="hl-orange">consumers</em> support multiple replay
      policies.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em class="hl-yellow">all</em> of the messages currently stored in the
        stream, meaning a complete <strong>replay</strong> and you can select
        the <strong>replay policy</strong>(i.e. the speed of the replay) to be
        either:
      </li>
      <dl>
        <dt class="hl-green">instant</dt>
        <dd>
          the messages are delivered to the consumer as fast as it can take
          them.
        </dd>
        <dt class="hl-cyan">original</dt>
        <dd>
          the messages are delivered to the consumer at the rate they were
          published into the stream, which can be very useful for example for
          staging production traffic.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the <em class="hl-orange">last</em> message stored in the stream, or the
        <em class="hl-orange">last</em> message for each subject (as streams can
        capture more than on subject).
      </li>
      <li>
        starting from a specific <em class="hl-green">sequence number</em>.
      </li>
      <li>starting from a specific <em class="hl-cyan">start time</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Retention policies and limits</h2>
    Practically speaking, streams cannot always just keep growing forever and
    therefore JetStream support multiple retention policies as well as the
    ability to impose size limits on streams.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>limit</h3>
    <p>You can impose the following limits on a stream</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maximum message age</li>
      <li>Maximum total stream size (in bytes)</li>
      <li>Maximum number of messages in the stream</li>
      <li>Maximum individual message size</li>
      <li>
        You can also set limits on the number of consumers that can be defined
        for the stream at any given point in time.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You must also select a <strong>discard policy</strong> which specifies
      what should happen once the stream has reached one of its limits and a new
      message is published
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em class="hl-orange">discard old</em> means that the stream will
        automatically delete the oldest message in the stream to make room for
        the new messages.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em class="hl-orange">discard new</em> means that new message is
        discarded (and the JetStream publish call retuns an error indicating
        that a limit was reached)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Retention policy</h3>
    <p>You can choose what kind of retention you want for each stream</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em class="hl-orange">limits</em> (the default)</li>
      <li>
        <em class="hl-green">interest</em> (messages are kept in the stream for
        as long as there are consumers that haven't delivered the message yet).
      </li>
      <li>
        <em class="hl-yellow">work queue</em> (the stream is used as a shared
        queue and messages are removed from it as they consumed)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Regardless of the retention policy selected, the limits (and the discard
      policy) always apply.
    </p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section>
    <h2>Persistent distributed storage</h2>
    <p>
      You can choose the durability as well as the resilience of the message
      store according to your needs.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Memory storage</li>
      <li>File storage</li>
      <li>
        Replication (1 (none), 2, 3) between nats servers for Fault Tolerance
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>
      JetStream uses a NATS optimized
      <em class="hl-orange">RAFT distributed quorom algorithm</em> to distribute
      the persistence service between nats servers in a cluster while
      maintaining immediate consistency even in the face of Byzantine failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      In JetStream the configuration for
      <em class="hl-yellow">storing messages</em> is defined separately from how
      they are <em class="hl-green">consumed</em>.
    </p>
    <div class="box">
      <p>
        Storage is defined in a Stream and consuming messages is defined by
        multiple Consumers.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Stream replication factor</h3>
  <p>
    A stream's replication factor (R, often referred to as the number Replicas)
    determines how many places it is stored allowing you to tune to balance risk
    with resource usage and performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    A stream that is <strong class="hl-orange">easily rebuilt</strong> or
    <strong class="hl-cyan">temporary</strong> might be
    <em class="hl-green">memory based</em> with a
    <em class="hl-yellow">R=1</em> and a stream that can
    <strong class="hl-pink">telorate some downtime</strong> might be
    <em class="hl-green">file based</em> with <em class="hl-yellow">R=1</em>.
