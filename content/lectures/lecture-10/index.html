  <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
  <p>
  Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access
  to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (networks, virtual machines, storage, applications, and services)
  that can be rapidly provision and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <section>
    <h2>IaaS</h2>
    <p>
      Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that
      <em class="hl-orange">abstract</em>
      the user from the details of
      <strong class="hl-green">infrastructure</strong> like physical computing
      resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <li>Example providers:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>AWS Amazon</li>
      <li>Virtual Box</li>
      <li>VMware</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>PaaS</h2>
  <p>
    Platform as a service (PaaS) or application platform as a service (aPaaS) is
    a category of cloud computing services that
    <em class="hl-yellow">provides a platform</em> allowing customers to
    <strong class="hl-cyan">develop</strong>,
    <strong class="hl-orange">run</strong>, and
    <strong class="hl-green">manage</strong> applications without the complexity
    of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with
    developing and launching an app.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SaaS</h2>
  <p>
    SaaS applications are sometimes called
    <em class="hl-yellow">Web-based software</em>, on-demand software, or hosted
    software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications
    <strong class="hl-green">run on a SaaS provider‚Äôs servers</strong>. The
    provider manages access to the application, including security,
    availability, and performance.

    In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system.

  <h2>Virtualization Techniques</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The <strong>VM-based</strong> approach virtualizes the complete OS. The
      abstraction it presents to the VM are virtual devices like virtual disk,
      virtual CPUs, and virtual NICs. With virtual machines, multiple OSes can
      share the same hardware resources, with virtualized representations of
      each of the resources available to the VM.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Container-based</strong> form of virtualization doesn't abstract
      the hardware but uses techniques within the Linux kernel to isolate access
      paths for different resources. It carves out a logical boundary within the
      same operating system.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Hypervisors</h2>
  <p>A special piece of software is used to virtualize the OS.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <section>
    <h2>CPU Virtualization</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Binary Translation in the Case of Full Virtualization:</strong>
        In this case, the guest OS is used without any changes. The instructions
        are trapped and emulated for the target environment. This cause a lot of
        performance overhead, as lots of instructions have to be trapped into
        the host/hypervisor and emulated.
      </li>
      <li>
        To avoid the performance problems related to binary translation when
        using full virtulization, we use
        <strong>paravirtualization</strong> wherein the guest knows that it is
        running in a virtualized environment and its interaction with the host
        is optimized to avoid excessive trapping.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>CPU Virtualization (Contd)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In 2005, x86 finally become virtualizable. Advantages of
        <strong>hardware-assisted virtulization</strong>
        are two fold:
        <ul>
          <li>No binary translation</li>
          <li>No OS modification</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>IO Virtualization</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        With <strong>full virtualization</strong>, the guest does not know it's
        running on a hypervisor and the guest OS doesn't need any changes to run
        on a hypervisor.
      </li>
      <li>
        In <strong>paravirtualization</strong> case, the guest OS is made aware
        that it's running in a vritualized environment and special drivers are
        loaded into the guest to take care of the I/O.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The Quick Emulator (QEMU)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The QEMU runs as a user process and handles the KVM kernel module.</li>
    <li>
      It uses the <code>vt-x</code> extensions to provide the guest with an
      isolated environment from a memory and cpu perspective.
    </li>
    <li>
      The QEMU also dedicates a separate thread for I/O. This thread runs an
      event loop and is based on the non-blocking mechanism.
    </li>
    <li>The QEMU can use paravirtualized drivers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Containers</h2>
  <p>
    Containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and
    dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and
    share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated
    processes in user space.

  Linux containers are made of three Linux kernel primitives:
  <ul>
    <li>Linux namespaces</li>
    <li>cgroups</li>
    <li>Layered file systems</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Namespace</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A <em>namespace</em> is a logical isolation within the Linux kernel.
    </li>
    <li>A namespace controls visibility within the kernel.</li>
    <li>All controls are defined at the process level.</li>

  <h2>Docker Image</h2>
  <p>
    An image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes
    everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime,
    libraries, environment variables, and config files.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Docker Container</h2>
  <p>
    A container is a runtime instance of an image ‚Äì what the image becomes in
    memory when actually executed. It runs completely isolated from the host
    environment by default, only accessing host files and ports if configured to
    do so.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Dockerfile</h2>
  <p>
    A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could
    call on the command line to assemble an image.
